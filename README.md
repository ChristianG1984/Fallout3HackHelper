# Fallout 3 - Hack Helper #

This small app helps to hack the terminals in the game _Fallout 3_.

_This is a sample image of the hack console how you would find it in the game. 
Really funny: You can play that small game right **[there](http://mitchellthompson.net/demos/terminal/)** (and solve it eventually with my small tool! :wink:)_


## Motivation ##
Well, it can be funny to solve this small game on your own! But later on, I found these riddles really annoying. (Especially, when you want to focus your mind on the story.)

I tried to search on google if there is eventually such a tool present. But I found nothing.

And so I decided to code such a tool. :smile:
(I really enjoyed the problem solving process. In the end, the solution looks really simple. But in the first, I struggled and went in the wrong problem solving direction.)

## Usage Guide ##
On the left pane is the text area, where you type in the possible words of the hack console. (Each word has to be on it's own row.)
The right pane shows the calculated probability percentage of the words.

The following picture shows such a sample riddle, which I got in the game:

You can see the possible words on the right side. Since there is no hint given, all words have an equally distributed probability percentage.
In the real game, you have to choose one word.

In that example, I have chosen the word `SELLING`.
The game gave me the hint, that 3 characters in the word are on the right position.
So, I just type in the `3` behind the word `SELLING` separated with a blank space.
The software will instantly recalculate the probability percentage of the remaining words.

The result is shown in the next screenshot:

Now, there are only two words left, which are possible.
So, I have chosen the word `DRIVING` and it was the right one. :grinning:
